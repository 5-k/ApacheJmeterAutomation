Please upload all contents folder wise here, the directory should not have space.

When you upload the html report, you need to upload sb-Content and content folder also.
To do that first create your folder.

Lets Say
Find PO

Since there is no option to create folder, upload index.html and in Advanced setting,
Mention Upload to folder.

Now move inside this folder and upload "content" folder's contents and upload to folder named "content"
Same for sbAdmin folder.

If you have stats and jtl/log file, you can upload to the same folder as index.
